# Novel Computer Vision Tasks
Indexing interesting new tasks and problems introduced in Computer Vision conferences. Currently covering CVPR/ICCV/ECCV/AAAI/NeurIPS. This list by no means is comprehensive; so, if you see a missing task, please open an issue :bug:.

## AAAI 2021
- [DramaQA: Character-Centered Video Story Understanding with Hierarchical QA](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/16203) by Choi et al.

	> *A new variation of Video QA centering on character-based video annotations.*

- [Mind-the-Gap! Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Text-Video Retrieval](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/16192) by Chen et al.

	> *Proposes a benchmark for text to video retrieval task under domain shift between training and testing datasets.*

<br />

- [GIF Thumbnails: Attract More Clicks to Your Videos](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/16416) by Xu et al.

	> *A new task (and a dataset) for creating a GIF thumbnail from a given video -different from [Video2GIF](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04850)(CVPR'16), the output covers multiple shots.*

## AAAI 2020
- [OVL: One-View Learning for Human Retrieval](https://ojs.aaai.org//index.php/AAAI/article/view/6804) by Li et al.

	> *Person Re-ID where labeled samples are available from a single camera view (source), and also the target views may have identities that are not available in the source view (aka unknown ids).*
